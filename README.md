# Pacman

### This is created to collaborate on the Operating Systems semester project.

#### Creators: Muhammad Asjadullah & Hammad Muhammad Siddique

##### Version 01

I have created a maze with the pellets and walls. I have not added the player yet.


#### Version 02

I have added the player to the game and have also implemented the player motion. Currently the player is static and moves with the keys. Later, we can update it to make the motion as exactly the same in Pacman.


##### Version 03

I have added collision detection to the game. The player can now collect pellets and collide with the walls. I have also created a UI thread and implemented the scoring mechanics, where the player gets 1 score for each pellet collected.


##### Version 04

I have added the menu, with three buttons: play, help and exit. But the help button is not functional yet. Also, I have added pacman logo at the top-center and have added the high-score text. I have added the enemy sprites as well. The game does save highscores yet nor are the enemies functional.


##### Version 05

I have added the power pellets to the game. The player gains speed on collecting the power pellet. The effect of the power pellet lasts for 7 seconds. Alongside, I have also added 4 enemy sprites.


##### Version 06

I have created movements for two of the enemies: the pink and the blue ones. They move in the lower section of the map and have pre-defined paths
